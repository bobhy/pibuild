# command line parameter.

interface=ap0

# For nl80211, this parameter can be used to request the AP interface to be
# added to the bridge automatically (brctl may refuse to do this before hostapd
# has been started to change the interface mode). If needed, the bridge
# interface is also created.

# g = IEEE 802.11g (2.4 GHz), ad = IEEE 802.11ad (60 GHz); a/g options are used
# with IEEE 802.11n (HT), too, to specify band). For IEEE 802.11ac (VHT), this
# needs to be set to hw_mode=a. When using ACS (see channel parameter), a
# special value "any" can be used to indicate that any support band can be used.
# This special case is currently supported only with drivers with which
# offloaded ACS is used.
# Default: IEEE 802.11b

# Please note that some drivers do not use this value from hostapd and the
# channel will need to be configured separately with iwconfig.
#
# If CONFIG_ACS build option is enabled, the channel can be selected
# automatically at run time by setting channel=acs_survey or channel=0, both of
# which will enable the ACS survey based algorithm.

# Enable WPA. Setting this variable configures the AP to require WPA (either

# wpa_psk or wpa_passphrase must be set and wpa_key_mgmt must include WPA-PSK.
# Instead of wpa_psk / wpa_passphrase, wpa_psk_radius might suffice.
# For WPA-RADIUS/EAP, ieee8021x must be set (but without dynamic WEP keys),
# RADIUS authentication server must be configured, and WPA-EAP must be included
# in wpa_key_mgmt.
# This field is a bit field that can be used to enable WPA (IEEE 802.11i/D3.0)
# and/or WPA2 (full IEEE 802.11i/RSN):
# bit0 = WPA
# bit1 = IEEE 802.11i/RSN (WPA2) (dot11RSNAEnabled)
# Note that WPA3 is also configured with bit1 since it uses RSN just like WPA2.
# In other words, for WPA3, wpa=2 is used the configuration (and
# wpa_key_mgmt=SAE for WPA3-Personal instead of wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK).
wpa=2

# WPA pre-shared keys for WPA-PSK. This can be either entered as a 256-bit
# secret in hex format (64 hex digits), wpa_psk, or as an ASCII passphrase
# (8..63 characters) that will be converted to PSK. This conversion uses SSID
# so the PSK changes when ASCII passphrase is used and the SSID is changed.
